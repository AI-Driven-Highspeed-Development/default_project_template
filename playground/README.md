# Project Playground

Interactive exploration space for project-level experimentation.

## Purpose

Use this folder for:
- Cross-module experiments
- System-level demos
- Quick prototyping before formalizing into modules

## Structure

```
playground/
├── README.md           # This file
└── explore_*.py        # Exploration scripts
```

## Usage

```bash
# From project root with venv activated
python playground/explore_example.py
```

## Note

Playground code is NOT production code. Move validated patterns into proper modules.
